Using G++ to compile multiple .cpp and .h files
I've just inherited some C++ code that was written poorly with one cpp file which contained the main and a bunch of other functions. 
There are also .h files that contain classes and their function definitions. Until now the program was compiled using the command g++ main.cpp.
Now that I've separated the classes to .h and .cpp files do I need to use a makefile or can I still use the g++ main.cpp command?

Solution:
list all the other cpp files after main.cpp.

ie

g++ main.cpp other.cpp etc.cpp
and so on.

Or you can compile them all individually. You then link all the resulting ".o" files together.
-o can be used to set the resulting name.
You can even do g++ *.cpp -o output

To compile separately without linking you need to add -c option:
Basically this will generate a .o file you can then compile with others.
Makes things cleaner for removing files to clean up.
g++ -c myclass.cpp
g++ -c main.cpp
g++ myclass.o main.o
./a.out

Now that I've separated the classes to .h and .cpp files do I need to use a makefile or can I still use the "g++ main.cpp" command?

Compiling several files at once is a poor choice if you are going to put that into the Makefile.

Normally in a Makefile (for GNU/Make), it should suffice to write that:

# "all" is the name of the default target, running "make" without params would use it
all: executable1

# for C++, replace CC (c compiler) with CXX (c++ compiler) which is used as default linker
CC=$(CXX)

# tell which files should be used, .cpp -> .o make would do automatically
executable1: file1.o file2.o

That way make would be properly recompiling only what needs to be recompiled. One can also add few tweaks to generate the header file dependencies 
- so that make would also properly rebuild what's need to be rebuilt due to the header file changes.

CC := g++
CFLAGS := -Wall -g
TARGET := test

# $(wildcard *.cpp /xxx/xxx/*.cpp): get all .cpp files from the current directory and dir "/xxx/xxx/"
SRCS := $(wildcard *.cpp)
# $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(SRCS)): substitute all ".cpp" file name strings to ".o" file name strings
OBJS := $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(SRCS))

all: $(TARGET)
$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CC) -o $@ $^
%.o: %.cpp
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<
clean:
	rm -rf $(TARGET) *.o
	
.PHONY: all clean
