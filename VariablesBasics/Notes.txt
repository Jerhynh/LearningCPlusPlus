Variables: Reference to an object or value stored in memory.

Variables have a type and a value.
The type specifies what is legal to be stored in a variable.

***
Variables are case sensitive!
***
Variable names cannot contain spaces!
***
Cannot use a reserved name for a variable!
***

You should be consistent with the variable names that you use. (camelCase could work best.)
Use meaningful names for your variables.
Remember to initialize (assign a value to a variable) prior to using that variable.

Example: 

    int age {69};
    //optionally can use: int age = 69;
